With a strategic mindset and hands-
on experience, I drive impactful
results across websites, social media
campaigns, and digital initiatives by
aligning creative vision with
business objectives.
My expertise includes conducting
in-depth communication audits
and developing charters that
define tone, messaging, and
channel used for both traditional
and digital media.
I specialize in the full-cycle
production of corporate videos and
oversee video projects in
collaboration with external
agencies, ensuring all content
aligns with brand identity.
Our company’s website had not received any updates or maintenance for over two years. I led the call for tender process to find a qualified agency
capable of managing a full transition—from the outdated CMS Drupal to CMS WordPress. This included a complete redesign of our web marketing
approach, with a strong focus on user experience, measurable performance, and robust SEO optimization to improve visibility and engagement.
Selecting the right agency was our key to meeting
our needs, solving challenges, and delivering a
visually high-performance website.

Figma to conceptualize and refine ideas.
Managed articles and video content, ensuring all
visuals aligned with Ajinomoto Group’s brand
guidelines.

using Asana to ensure smooth performance across
all devices.
I ensured the new website was designed with a
user-first approach-responsive, fast, well-
structured, and accessible to all users.

keyword analysis, including content creation.

Before the Project
To kick off the project, I conducted a full audit of the existing website, assessing its last update, security status, and overall structure. I
collected and consolidated requirements from key stakeholders, including Marketing, Quality, HR, and General Management, to draft a
comprehensive specifications document. I identified and evaluated five potential web agencies, led pricing negotiations, and organized a
final presentation meeting to select the most suitable partner.
‍
During the Project
Once the project was launched, I created a detailed roadmap outlining key phases: content production, UI/UX design, testing, and CMS
integration (WordPress). I collaborated closely with the project manager and the artistic director of the sub contractor to ensure optimal
design and user experience wire frames.
I was also responsible for writing content, producing videos, and preparing all materials in terms of images, web hosting, legal pages for
the website launch. Regular stakeholder meetings ensured alignment and on-time delivery. The testing phase was a top priority, I oversaw
comprehensive testing of all links and functionalities across devices to guarantee flawless performance.
After the Project
Post-launch, I implemented a content maintenance and optimization plan, outlining tasks to be done monthly and semi-annually. This
ensured the website stayed fresh, relevant, and SEO-friendly to secure and improve its ranking on Google.

Our company initiated the development of a new client extranet platform aimed at serving external partners, the Quality department, and the Sales
department. This extranet is designed to store and generate key documents such as certificates, statements, and legal documentation requested by
clients. This solution replaces the outdated and time-consuming process where the Quality department manually created documents and distributed
them via email. In addition to streamlining document generation, the project addresses a major challenge: document fragmentation. Currently, files
are stored and managed across multiple locations—including our internal storage platform and various Excel files—making it difficult to access and
share consistent information. To resolve this, we developed a data transfer bridge (passerelle) to integrate and synchronize documents from the
internal systems into the new extranet.

Due to its scope and complexity, the project involves multiple stakeholders across departments, requiring clear communication and regular updates
for all cross-functional teams at each phase of development. This has been a critical factor in ensuring alignment and progress throughout the lifecycle
of the project.
Selecting the right agency was our key to meeting
our needs, solving challenges, and delivering a

Before the Project
To kick off the extranet client project, I led a detailed assessment of the current document management processes, identifying
inefficiencies and fragmentation across departments. I gathered and consolidated requirements from key stakeholders—Quality, Sales, IT,
and external partners—to develop a comprehensive functional and technical specification. This document defined all platform features,
user roles, workflows, and integration needs. I also coordinated project scope, timelines, and communication plans to ensure alignment
from day one.


During the Project
I created a detailed roadmap covering development phases, including architecture design, data bridge (passerelle) creation, platform
development, and rigorous testing. I facilitated collaboration between cross-functional teams through regular updates, sprint reviews, and
stakeholder meetings. I oversaw the integration of automated document generation, access control, and security measures, while ensuring
seamless synchronization of documents from internal systems.


After the Project
Post-launch, I implemented a structured training program for internal users and provided support resources for external partners. I
established a feedback and monitoring system to track performance, address issues, and plan iterative improvements. To maintain the
extranet, I defined ongoing maintenance and update schedules, ensuring the extranet remains efficient, secure, and aligned with evolving
business needs.

I have always been passionate about video production and have had the opportunity to apply this passion across every company I’ve worked with. My
experience spans the entire production process, from scripting and agenda planning to filming, post-production, music selection, and subtitling.

I have created a variety of video content, including interviews, event, career testimonials, and corporate video. In addition, I’ve also collaborated
closely with photographer and producer agency, gaining hands-on experience both behind and in front of the camera.

At AFE, where communication is a newly established function, my role focuses on strengthening the brand image in Europe, supporting sales growth,
fostering a sense of belonging within the group, and enhancing relationships with clients and partners.

I lead the creation and management of content for social media channels including YouTube and LinkedIn, and I’ve built a dedicated Division
community on Workplace to streamline internal communication. I also coordinate visual content production for marketing campaigns on Instagram.
In addition to external communications, I am responsible for managing the company’s Yammer and Workplace pages, which are essential internal
communication platforms. These channels play a crucial role in fostering a strong sense of connection and engagement among employees across
different regions. They are used to share important company news, communicate with affiliates, and report key results and achievements to the
Ajinomoto group.

Beyond information sharing, these platforms also serve as dynamic tools for enhancing internal culture. I utilize them to launch internal surveys,
gather employee feedback, and organize initiatives such as recognition awards and contests. These activities not only contribute to a more cohesive and
motivated workforce but also align with the company’s values of transparency, collaboration, and employee involvement.
I developed a comprehensive social media
strategy with an editorial charter including
messaging guidelines, tone tailored to target
audiences, content length recommendations, key
topics, and strategic calendar of important dates.
Based on the strategy, I executed a structured
content collection plan, involving and contacting
relevant contributors, conducting interviews,
and producing high-quality written and video
content based on the gathered insights.
I ensure all content is published on time and in
accordance with the editorial schedule, and I
deliver monthly performance reports to the
General Manager.

I led the development of the quarterly print newsletter, a longstanding communication tool within the Africa and Indian Ocean cluster. In response to
the COVID-19 pandemic and structural changes within the group, I successfully guided the transition to a digital format—transforming a traditional
medium into a more agile and impactful communication channel.

This digital shift enhanced accessibility, enabled faster distribution, and significantly improved audience engagement. By integrating analytics tools
and QR codes, we were able to track detailed performance metrics, including view rates, interaction levels, and geographic reach, allowing for data-
driven improvements and targeted content strategies.
I draft an editorial charter outlines the principles, tone,
and guidelines that shape the content for all topic. It
aligns with the brand identity, and supports the
communication with the employees effectively.
The newsletter is printed in the required quantities for
each country and distributed accordingly across our
cluster to ensure local reach and visibility.
Due to COVID-19 and recent changes within the group, it
became essential to shift to digital newsletters. This
transition helped address several challenges, including
accessibility, timely distribution, and improved
engagement across regions.
By leveraging analytics tools and QR codes, we are able to
track key insights from the newsletter, including view rates,
engagement levels (such as likes), and geographic
distribution by country.
Using Figma, I design all newsletter pages and
collaborate closely with the graphic designer to ensure
visual consistency and high-quality layout execution.
