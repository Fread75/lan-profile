I am writing to express my strong interest in the Events \& Swag (Events \& Brand Experience Associate) position at Kalshi. Your mission to "bring more truth to the world through the power of markets" resonates with me, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to creating unforgettable brand experiences that support this innovative approach to prediction markets.

My experience in digital marketing and communication aligns perfectly with Kalshi's need for someone with a "builder's mindset" and cultural awareness. At Ajinomoto Foods Europe, I successfully managed comprehensive brand experiences, from launching LinkedIn and YouTube channels from scratch to organizing large-scale events for up to 3,000 participants at Imperial Tobacco Limited. I understand how to create experiences that feel authentic and memorable while driving measurable business results. My track record includes increasing SEO traffic by 80\% through strategic website redesigns and building social media presences that reached top-five performance among competitors within six months.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to work at the intersection of events and brand building in a startup environment. I have experience managing complex projects from initial concept to execution - whether it's redesigning corporate websites, producing video content, or coordinating cross-functional teams across multiple countries. My approach combines creative vision with practical project management skills, using tools like Asana and Figma to ensure smooth execution. I also have a proven eye for design and cultural trends, having managed social media strategies that reached 33k followers on Instagram and developed visual content that strengthened brand identity across international markets.

I am particularly drawn to Kalshi's culture of meritocracy and ownership. Throughout my career, I have thrived in environments where I can take initiative and build scalable processes. At Imperial Tobacco, I led communication initiatives across 11 countries, developing processes that improved employee motivation by 10\% while maintaining consistent brand messaging. I believe my experience in building processes that work across different markets and cultures would be valuable as Kalshi continues to grow and expand its reach.
